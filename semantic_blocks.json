One category, Shilapuravapad explains is that of the empiric philosophers who try to speculate and try to understand what is truth. So using their own limited understanding, their intelligence, they think they will be able to understand Lord. Although they cannot understand Lord. but they think they can understand the creator of the universe. So that is not sign of intelligence, but they think they are intelligent. So they are called Ganesh. So they can never understand God. And then there is another category. In India you will find many such people and otherwise also. this categories. categories, send Dementilist, they think they have attained perfection of life. Sehjiya, they take things very easily.

Yes those who are perfect, they need not understand. So how do we understand whether a person is perfect or not? That is why Bhagavad Gita is so relevant. When Krishna explained to Arjuna the fundamental spiritual life and to come to platform of divinity, Arjuna asked, what are the symptoms of a person who is having this divine consciousness? Where does Arjuna ask? Then ask second chapter. Sita praggasya, praggasya kaavhasha, samadhi sthasya ke shava, one who is situated in such samadhi that one is completely absorbed in the thoughts of Krishna, Sita praggyah is called his intelligence is fixed. Intelligence of materialist is never fixed. It is on the material platform. So the intelligence is fixed on the spiritual platforms. Kabhaasha, Samadhi, Satsya Keshava, who is situated in such Samadhi, what are the symptoms? So what does Lord Krishna describe? From here we can understand whether a person is actually perfect or he is simply having sentimental emotional display. So first symptom Prabhupāda explains this, Arjuna also asks Kabhaasha, what does he speak? how does he speak and what is his life? So of all the symptoms, the most important symptom is language. That is why it is told Guru or the saintly person should be seen from the ears and not from the eyes. One will be mistaken even if one sees external behavior, one follows the eyes. That is why whole world is getting mistaken. So that is why it is told in the moral instructions that a fool is fool. as long as it does not speak. Somebody can behave like a nice sadhu.

He went and then he had to cross jungle forest. He could not eat very nicely and he had to drink water from here and there. And thus he developed a wet source on his body which were oozing pus. and thus very foul smell would come. And the smell was so bad that people might not be able to even come around him. And then he eventually, when he saw this thing has happened to me, then it all anyway I was having a bad association in the association of meat-eater Sifil and I am having a low birth low life and now my body is also become useless. useless.

He discussed with Jagadanand Pandit, another very close associate of Chhatanema Prabhu, he is incarnation of Satyabhama, one of the principal queens of Krishna.

So, Jagadanand Pandit to It is so he told, yes, it is nice addition if I go, I will be able to avoid this offense. And then when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Sanatana Goswami expressed that, I have discussed with Jagadanand and he has recommended me to go to Vrindavan. So Mahaprabhu became very angry. That Jagad, that young boy, he has told like this, you are on the level of spiritual master and he dare speak. Anvinsanathan Goswami heard this. Then he became baroos and then he told, Now I know that you consider me an external. And now I know your favour towards Jagadanand Pandit. A person chastises only people who are close to him. So Jagadanand is so close to him. he is so dear to you that thus you offer me respects. And then Chattanemaapra became embarrassed when he heard this. And then he told, no, that is not fact. But this is fact which chastise only people who are close to us. So Chattanemaapra we became little embarrassed when he heard this statement from Sanatangaswami. and then it will not, don't feel like this and actually Now, understand Sonathan, what is my mind?

Although we should not imitate advanced personalities like Arjuna who just work very hard for Krishna without chanting, we have to chant also. Unless we chant, we will not be able to work hard for Krishna, but we should come to this platform. This is a real secret. It is an open secret. But unless we take shelter of a spiritual master, we will not be able to understand this secret. it. Krishna has openly declared who is most dear to me. Manu preaches very clearly it is told, na chata smath manu but who preaches nobody preaches, you see in Krishna consciousness movement also nobody preaches. Everyone chants does DT worship, offers bhoga, eats prasadam, go to vrindavan dham, do karthik everything but nobody preaches because it is uncomfortable activity to go out, venture old planet. That is why it is called confidential, you keep on reading, keep on hearing, well, we will not realise, I have to do this thing, when we will not realise. A small fraction are able to realise and you see their spiritual advancement. Those who have worked very hard for preaching, they were advanced so fast, so quickly, so quickly they have advanced, they get all realisation. They might not have even finished Bhagavad Gita, little bit they will read and they will realize everything. And others have become great scholars, have spent many many years in Krishna consciousness, but same, Dhritarastra, what my sons will do, what my sons will get, what my daughters will get, this calculation goes on, what I will get. So, we have to understand, Prabhupattas, we have to please Acharya's, Acharya's will please buy this we are not on the platform Acharya has shown by their own example. Haridas Thakura before he took to chanting, even door to door. And he requested people to chant. He met with unfavorable elements. So Vishnatha Chakravaarti Thakura explains, this is cultivation of Krishna consciousness. This is the Tapasya that we have to take. Without Tapasya, we cannot advance. It is not at all convenient to go and talk to strangers, start to convince people where nobody is interested in Krishna consciousness. It is not convenient. And when we go out we see nobody.

So thus and thus we understand that this is perfection of philosophy. Who follows Krishna, Varnam, Tushak, Krishna, and this is the way Chama Samuni told, Navyogindra has told Maharaj Nimi, Long ago in Bhagavatambit is recorded. So thus these things are there in the scriptures but it is confidential. That is why unless we take shelter of a bona fide Parampara we will not be to understand. following San Kirtan? Why am I not worshipping Lord Chaitanya? Krishna, Venom, Tusha, Krishna, he is the only incarnation who chants the name of Krishna, whose complexion is not this thing. Krishna, dark. So why am I not following Bhagavatam? It is not about this Sampradha, that Sampradha, I am already following something. No, understand. That that here is this sampled iZ Perfection culmination. So if I want perfection, I should try to follow it, follow these teachings. So I should worship Lord Caitanya, I should follow the instructions of Lord Caitanya, I should follow the instructions of Krishna, Krishna is only declared, nobody is dearer, bhavita natchametashman, in the future also nobody shall be dearer than the one who preaches. So the entire advancement of bhakti depends upon pleasing Krishna and Krishna is mostly So, thus we have to work very hard and following the footsteps of Acharya's and these are the instructions of Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. And by this we can attain perfection. I had a two-point question. Does preaching at any point of time get comfortable? Yes, so preaching also become. As we venture more or we take on more risk bigger, bigger responsibilities. Yes, now I am able to make hundred people chant. Plan how can I make thousand people chant now? Plan how can I make one million people? Plan how can I make entire country Krishna conscious? How to become? How to make Prime Minister a devotee? So like this we always increase it. The last one is that it's a war, Prabhupāta's preaching is war. The not-thing preaching is easy going, singing, dancing, chanting, harībho, sometimes. So, Prabhupāta's preaching is war. In war, there is risk. We have to take risk, Prabhupāta's Krishna becomes very much pleased when he sees devotees are taking risk for me. So, this is practical activity, Krishna is a person. When somebody takes risk for us, are we not pleased? So, that's we have to take risk for Krishna. There is a responsibility, there is risk, and there is danger, just as preaching. Just like in a war, a person keeps on taking greater risk. Now, let me defeat this king also. Let me defeat that king also. Let me defeat third king also. Entire world, my rule should be there. So, the preaching is war in this way we have to.",

If we are ourselves, not following what shall we preach? So thus Sanatana Goswami told Hari Dastaka, some people behave very nicely. Means they will follow, regulative principles, rules and regulations very nicely, but they will not preach. Others they preach but do not behave nicely. But you are so nice that you behave, you follow and then you preach also. This is what we have to do. We have to be very, very strict in following the rules and regulations and then preach. Then there would be perfection. So this we have to take help of devotees, how to follow rules and regulations nicely. Hare Krishna Prabhu, you said that we should follow Racharya and preach. but once I heard in one lecture that we should do only Yes, so authorized service will be nothing but service for preaching.
