[00:00] Speaker 1: There are two kinds of people who try to perfect their lives, but both are unable to do so.
[00:10] Speaker 1: One category, Shilapuravapad explains is that of the empiric philosophers who try to speculate
[00:18] Speaker 1: and try to understand what is truth.
[00:22] Speaker 1: So using their own limited understanding, their intelligence, they think they will be able
[00:27] Speaker 1: to understand Lord. Although they cannot understand Lord.
[00:34] Speaker 1: but they think they can understand the creator of the universe.
[00:37] Speaker 1: So that is not sign of intelligence, but they think they are intelligent.
[00:42] Speaker 1: So they are called Ganesh. So they can never understand God.
[00:46] Speaker 1: And then there is another category.
[00:51] Speaker 1: In India you will find many such people and otherwise also.
[00:55] Speaker 1: this categories.
[00:56] Speaker 1: categories, send Dementilist, they think they have attained perfection of life.
[01:07] Speaker 1: Sehjiya, they take things very easily. Bhakti is very easy. Need not read philosophy,
[01:14] Speaker 1: need not understand books and if I can have some emotions for Krishna, then I'm perfect.
[01:22] Speaker 1: I have realized God.
[01:38] Speaker 1: ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھاں ھا
[01:53] Speaker 1: 
[02:00] Speaker 1: There is shruti which means the four Vedas or the openishads. There is smriti which means the puranas, itihasas, itihas, adi.
[02:10] Speaker 1: And there are other bonafile literature, tantras etc. Shruti ismriti puran, adi, pancharatra, pancharatra, very important literature.
[02:19] Speaker 1: Within Vinah, so Bhakti has to...
[02:27] Speaker 1: So here the situation that we see the situation of Milling Kali a great distress of the inhabitants of Dwarka.
[02:34] Speaker 1: They were expecting Krishna's arrival at any moment.
[02:38] Speaker 1: They could not bear separation from Krishna even for a moment. So these are the signs of
[02:44] Speaker 1: ecstatic love of God
[02:48] Speaker 1: So, quite explains, these are the signs.
[02:53] Speaker 1: This is called prema bhakti.
[02:55] Speaker 1: This is our constitutional position and the perfection that we want to attain now.
[03:00] Speaker 1: But this situation is attained by following Vedhi bhakti,
[03:05] Speaker 1: by following the rules and regulations.
[03:07] Speaker 1: Without following the rules and regulations, nobody can live to spontaneous platform.
[03:13] Speaker 1: So those who think, I need not follow rules and regulations, but I am also
[03:22] Speaker 1: taking things very easily
[03:26] Speaker 1: So it is not easy that is why Pancher atar with he has been given specially for this age
[03:31] Speaker 1: Where people are very fallen where Vedic rules and regulations cannot be followed very strictly
[03:37] Speaker 1: But with he has to be followed very strictly we have to follow the rules and regulations
[03:43] Speaker 1: But no, see I am already having some terms of x-tips.
[03:48] Speaker 1: And yes, some people practice the display of such symptoms.
[03:54] Speaker 1: So, as soon as they hear Krishna's name, so I am a fee-lex-tracee and I will also roll
[04:04] Speaker 1: all the ground and I will have all these things.
[04:06] Speaker 1: So some people practice this on an external platform, on a material platform, it can be
[04:13] Speaker 1: practiced.
[04:19] Speaker 1: Diskin is burning, the throat is getting choked up and hairs are standing on it and goose bumps.
[04:27] Speaker 1: So, these are the symptoms of XTC. So, is Urjana in XTC? No. So, these symptoms are also
[04:33] Speaker 1: because of material attachment. So, Urjana is grief-stricken that I have to fight with
[04:41] Speaker 1: these people.
[04:44] Speaker 1: I have to kill my family members, Arjuna is very much worried and he is having a nervous
[04:50] Speaker 1: breakdown.
[04:51] Speaker 1: So these are the symptoms of great material attachment and similar is the manifestation
[04:56] Speaker 1: of symptoms of spontaneous love of God.
[05:00] Speaker 1: So that is why one has to be very expert but it is important that science, that love of
[05:05] Speaker 1: God is not a sentiment, it is a science.
[05:09] Speaker 1: Science means there are specific symptoms of it.
[05:09] Speaker 1: Science, music.
[05:12] Speaker 1: It is not something just like there are symptoms of any disease.
[05:16] Speaker 1: Similarly there are symptoms of a person having love of God.
[05:22] Speaker 1: So this one has to carefully understand.
[05:26] Speaker 1: If somebody is thinking that yes I am also having, I have come to the platform of Rama
[05:29] Speaker 1: Bhakti.
[05:31] Speaker 1: I need not follow those regulations, understand the philosophy.
[05:34] Speaker 1: I am already perfect.
[05:36] Speaker 1: Yes those who are perfect, they need not understand.
[05:41] Speaker 1: So how do we understand whether a person is perfect or not? That is why Bhagavad Gita is so relevant.
[05:48] Speaker 1: When Krishna explained to Arjuna the fundamental spiritual life and to come to platform of divinity,
[05:56] Speaker 1: Arjuna asked, what are the symptoms of a person who is having this divine consciousness? Where does Arjuna ask?
[06:04] Speaker 1: Then ask second chapter.
[06:09] Speaker 1: Sita praggasya, praggasya kaavhasha, samadhi sthasya ke shava, one who is situated in such
[06:15] Speaker 1: samadhi that one is completely absorbed in the thoughts of Krishna, Sita praggyah is called
[06:21] Speaker 1: his intelligence is fixed.
[06:24] Speaker 1: Intelligence of materialist is never fixed.
[06:27] Speaker 1: It is on the material platform.
[06:30] Speaker 1: So the intelligence is fixed on the spiritual platforms.
[06:35] Speaker 1: Kabhaasha, Samadhi, Satsya Keshava, who is situated in such Samadhi, what are the symptoms?
[06:41] Speaker 1: So what does Lord Krishna describe?
[06:43] Speaker 1: From here we can understand whether a person is actually perfect or he is simply having
[06:50] Speaker 1: sentimental emotional display.
[06:55] Speaker 1: So first symptom Prabhupāda explains this, Arjuna also asks Kabhaasha, what does he speak?
[07:00] Speaker 1: how does he speak and what is his life?
[07:03] Speaker 1: So of all the symptoms, the most important symptom is language.
[07:09] Speaker 1: That is why it is told Guru or the saintly person should be seen from the ears and not from the eyes.
[07:18] Speaker 1: One will be mistaken even if one sees external behavior, one follows the eyes.
[07:22] Speaker 1: That is why whole world is getting mistaken.
[07:25] Speaker 1: So that is why it is told in the moral instructions that a fool is fool.
[07:28] Speaker 1: as long as it does not speak.
[07:30] Speaker 1: Somebody can behave like a nice sadhu.
[07:37] Speaker 1: So, there is this organization of which I was part of,
[07:41] Speaker 1: I was falling there.
[07:43] Speaker 1: They also try to follow spiritual life.
[07:48] Speaker 1: And we have various practices that they keep more on silence for,
[07:52] Speaker 1: many, many days.
[07:55] Speaker 1: and
[07:58] Speaker 1: And so when they came to Jeppur, one of their sadhus, so we had one of our devotees, he met them.
[08:08] Speaker 1: We were having a common sympathizer supporter. He was staying at his place and Prabhu was going to preach him cultivated.
[08:15] Speaker 1: So he met him and he wanted to understand whether he is genuine or not.
[08:19] Speaker 1: So he was trying to understand, trying to ask. But he was not talking anything.
[08:23] Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
[08:32] Speaker 1: So, because as soon as you talk, you will be caught.
[08:38] Speaker 1: And then eventually he was caught when he started talking.
[08:43] Speaker 1: So thus you can display yourself as a very intelligent man, as a very learned person.
[08:47] Speaker 1: But as soon as you talk, then you will be caught.
[08:50] Speaker 1: Whether you are talking as per the instructions of Krishna or you are talking something else.
[08:54] Speaker 1: So that is why speech is the first symptom.
[08:57] Speaker 1: A person who is having Sita Prajya, who is having Krishna consciousness, he will always
[09:04] Speaker 1: talk of Krishna.
[09:06] Speaker 1: And what kind of talk of Krishna?
[09:07] Speaker 1: Many people may talk of Krishna.
[09:09] Speaker 1: And finally they say, I am Krishna or Krishna, somebody else.
[09:15] Speaker 1: They will talk of Krishna, understanding the actual position of Krishna.
[09:20] Speaker 1: And what is the actual position of Krishna?
[09:25] Speaker 1: iti matva bhajan te maam bodha bhavas saman vitha ha.
[09:29] Speaker 1: So Krishna is also telling in chattushloki bhagvat gita.
[09:34] Speaker 1: The most important four verses which are the seed of entire bhagvat gita.
[09:38] Speaker 1: That yes bhavas saman vitha is important.
[09:41] Speaker 1: Man must feel emotions for Krishna but this is very advanced stage.
[09:46] Speaker 1: And this advanced stage is based on
[09:48] Speaker 1: the perfect
[09:54] Speaker 1: I am the source of all many festations,
[09:56] Speaker 1: matta sarvam Prabhatate.
[09:58] Speaker 1: So when Mani's Tharali convinced that entire many festations
[10:02] Speaker 1: is coming from Krishna and it is controlled by Krishna,
[10:05] Speaker 1: iti matva bhajan te mam,
[10:07] Speaker 1: such people engage in my bhajan, my service,
[10:10] Speaker 1: Buddha, who are very, very learned,
[10:11] Speaker 1: Buddha bhava saman vitaaha,
[10:14] Speaker 1: such learned people,
[10:15] Speaker 1: they are able to worship me with great bhawai.
[10:31] Speaker 1: So, thus understanding scientifically the position of Krishna is very, very important.
[10:38] Speaker 1: Otherwise, unless one talks, one will not be able to understand.
[10:42] Speaker 1: So, one should not get carried away by the external symptoms.
[10:49] Speaker 1: out how good Sadhu a person is or whether a person is Sadhu or not. This is the first
[10:54] Speaker 1: symptom. He will be talking of Krishna and pure devotional service for Krishna, nothing
[10:59] Speaker 1: else. No material benefit. He will be talking the same thing. Man Manavav Madhbhakt
[11:04] Speaker 1: Madhyajimam Namaskul, think of me, become my devotee, Saradhar Man Parityajya, give up
[11:09] Speaker 1: all other duties and surrender into me completely.
[11:16] Speaker 1: repeat these instructions. This is the first symptom. And then if you are convinced
[11:21] Speaker 1: like this, then other symptoms which Krishna mentions, Sri Bhagavanu, Aachana,
[11:26] Speaker 1: Krishna is describing, what is the situation of a person, Samadhi, Sastya Keishava,
[11:31] Speaker 1: who is in Samadhi, who is having perfect Krishna consciousness?
[11:35] Speaker 1: Pradhyadiyada Kamaan Sarvapartha Manogatan.
[11:41] Speaker 1: Atmannevat Manatushtha Sita Pragyas Tadhochyate.
[11:41] Speaker 1: Atmanneva.
[11:45] Speaker 1: First symptom is Prajahati Kaaman.
[11:48] Speaker 1: He will give up all material desires, all desires of sensual enjoyment.
[11:54] Speaker 1: Prajahati Yada Kaaman Sarvan Parth Manogatan, why he will give up?
[12:01] Speaker 1: It does not mean he becomes desireless.
[12:03] Speaker 1: Yes, he gives up desires which are material in nature which are actually mental concoction.
[12:11] Speaker 1: So Sanatang Goswami when he traveled to meet Chetanema Aprabhu, he went from Dindavan.
[12:16] Speaker 1: He went and then he had to cross jungle forest.
[12:23] Speaker 1: He could not eat very nicely and he had to drink water from here and there.
[12:27] Speaker 1: And thus he developed a wet source on his body which were oozing pus.
[12:35] Speaker 1: and thus very foul smell would come.
[12:41] Speaker 1: And the smell was so bad that people might not be able to even come around him.
[12:47] Speaker 1: And then he eventually, when he saw this thing has happened to me, then it all anyway I
[12:52] Speaker 1: was having a bad association in the association of meat-eater Sifil and I am having a low
[13:01] Speaker 1: birth low life and now my body is also become useless.
[13:04] Speaker 1: useless. It is of no use in the service of Jagannath. What is the use of this life? In this way he was
[13:10] Speaker 1: lamenting. But anyway, his lamentation increased even more when he saw that Chetanema Apra was coming
[13:19] Speaker 1: and embracing him because Sanatana Goswami is very advanced devotee. And as soon as Chetanema Apra would
[13:24] Speaker 1: see him, Chetanema Apra would embrace him. And Sanatana Goswami would feel very bad that people
[13:33] Speaker 1: can not even...
[13:58] Speaker 1: Let me die. I will see lot Jagannath many comes out on Deerath.
[14:04] Speaker 1: in this way decided. So Chetanemaaprava, but still Chetanemaaprava, anytime he would go to meet
[14:11] Speaker 1: Sanatanguswami, he was living with Haridas Thakur, he would embrace him. And then Sanatanguswami,
[14:20] Speaker 1: he felt very bad finally one day and then eventually this topic came up and then Chetanemaaprava
[14:26] Speaker 1: told that so in between what happened.
[14:31] Speaker 1: Short.
[14:33] Speaker 1: He discussed with Jagadanand Pandit, another very close associate of Chhatanema Prabhu,
[14:39] Speaker 1: he is incarnation of Satyabhama, one of the principal queens of Krishna.
[14:46] Speaker 1: So Jagadanandand Pandit, Sanatana Goswami, they were discussing and it was, this is my
[14:50] Speaker 1: situation.
[14:51] Speaker 1: What do I do now?
[14:52] Speaker 1: Instead of rendering service to Lord Chhatanema, I am causing this great offense.
[14:55] Speaker 1: So, Jagadanand Pandit to
[15:00] Speaker 1: It is so he told, yes, it is nice addition if I go, I will be able to avoid this offense.
[15:06] Speaker 1: And then when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Sanatana Goswami expressed that, I have discussed with
[15:11] Speaker 1: Jagadanand and he has recommended me to go to Vrindavan.
[15:15] Speaker 1: So Mahaprabhu became very angry.
[15:17] Speaker 1: That Jagad, that young boy, he has told like this, you are on the level of spiritual master
[15:23] Speaker 1: and he dare speak.
[15:31] Speaker 1: Anvinsanathan Goswami heard this.
[15:35] Speaker 1: Then he became baroos and then he told,
[15:38] Speaker 1: Now I know that you consider me an external.
[15:43] Speaker 1: And now I know your favour towards Jagadanand Pandit.
[15:46] Speaker 1: A person chastises only people who are close to him.
[15:50] Speaker 1: So Jagadanand is so close to him.
[15:52] Speaker 1: he is so dear to you that
[15:57] Speaker 1: thus you offer me respects. And then Chattanemaapra became embarrassed when he heard this.
[16:04] Speaker 1: And then he told, no, that is not fact. But this is fact which chastise only people who are close to us.
[16:13] Speaker 1: So Chattanemaapra we became little embarrassed when he heard this statement from Sanatangaswami.
[16:17] Speaker 1: and then it will not, don't feel like this and actually
[16:23] Speaker 1: Now, understand Sonathan, what is my mind?
[16:25] Speaker 1: So, actually I do not feel any bad fragrance at all
[16:30] Speaker 1: when I touch you and embrace you.
[16:32] Speaker 1: Rather, I feel the smell of sandalwood.
[16:35] Speaker 1: When I embrace your body, your body is completely spiritual in nature.
[16:39] Speaker 1: It has got no material contamination.
[16:41] Speaker 1: You can purify entire universe.
[16:43] Speaker 1: What to speak of your body getting contaminated?
[16:45] Speaker 1: created. So, thus this is called spiritual vision.
[16:50] Speaker 1: From a material platform, that is why it is told,
[16:53] Speaker 1: out of eleven verses, Rukh Goswami has explained this verse,
[16:58] Speaker 1: that the body of a Vashnava should not be considered material.
[17:02] Speaker 1: All the from materialize, we will perceive the body as material.
[17:06] Speaker 1: We may perceive the defects, that they are also having the similar defects.
[17:09] Speaker 1: He is an Athan Goswami, you are telling his liberated person.
[17:12] Speaker 1: He is having sinful life, he is having sinful reactions on his body.
[17:15] Speaker 1: see how you can tell is eternal association.
[17:19] Speaker 1: Chul no.
[17:26] Speaker 1: Dhrishtaisvabhava janitay vapuchashchaloke. Dhrishtaisvabhava janitay from one's material conditioning
[17:33] Speaker 1: one will develop certain perceptions of the pure vashnava.
[17:39] Speaker 1: Vapuchashchach doshe vapu means body and one will find doshe falls in the body of a pure vashnava.
[17:45] Speaker 1: आप भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भु़ भ�
[17:45] Speaker 1: 
[17:49] Speaker 1: Dhrrsta is of how a Janitae, Vapuja Shadoshay, but it is told just like Ganges one does not
[17:56] Speaker 1: see any contamination in it. Similarly, the body of a pure Vesnava is completely spiritual
[18:03] Speaker 1: and one should not see material contaminations. And thus, Chaitanya Mahaprava was having
[18:09] Speaker 1: real perception of the body of a Vashnamar.
[18:13] Speaker 1: What is the real perception as soon as such body is seen, as soon as such body is touched,
[18:13] Speaker 1: What is the...
[18:19] Speaker 1: one immediately is able to remember Krishna and is able to feel spiritual ecstasy.
[18:23] Speaker 1: But on material platform, one might find material faults, but Chetanema Apra was telling
[18:29] Speaker 1: that, I am getting the fragrance of sandalwood from your body in body completely spiritual.
[18:35] Speaker 1: And the side do not feel at all what you are talking, the pus and the contamination.
[18:39] Speaker 1: It is completely pure in nature.
[18:48] Speaker 1: So that is why when imperfect question, perfect answers we have understood when the discussion was about a prasadam
[18:55] Speaker 1: that whether a devotee can avoid certain kind of prasadam. Let's say chilli. We have a dispungent in nature
[19:01] Speaker 1: So because it is prasadam coming from Krishna should we still eat it?
[19:05] Speaker 1: So, for our part to leave, it is completely spiritual, but as long as we are not on the spiritual
[19:13] Speaker 1: Because we are not on the spiritual platform, that is why we have to see what suits our body.
[19:18] Speaker 1: We may avoid certain things even though it is prasadam.
[19:22] Speaker 1: We have to see what is good for our health.
[19:24] Speaker 1: Otherwise, it is completely prasadam and a pure devotee does not discriminate.
[19:28] Speaker 1: This is pungent, this is chile, this is good, this is bad.
[19:31] Speaker 1: Anything coming from Krishna is.
[19:32] Speaker 1: the smadvinnirpuri, heid the sweet rice, heid the pot of sweet rice also.
[19:43] Speaker 1: exalted behavior. And then Mahaprabhu explained another important concept. Even though I consider
[19:50] Speaker 1: okay, from the material perspective, let's say your body is not spiritual, then even from
[19:56] Speaker 1: the material perspective, I am sannyasi. And a sannyasi is not supposed to discriminate
[20:02] Speaker 1: that this is good and this is bad and then he explained the
[20:11] Speaker 1: Dwaita-bhadra-bhadra-ghyana.
[20:15] Speaker 1: Ae-sabh mano dharma.
[20:18] Speaker 1: Ae-bhalo, ae-manda, ae-sabh brahma.
[20:21] Speaker 1: Dwaita-dhis duality that this is good and this is bad.
[20:25] Speaker 1: Bhadra-bhadra-ghyan.
[20:27] Speaker 1: Ae-sabh mano dharma, this is mental concoction.
[20:31] Speaker 1: just like in a dream if I think
[20:37] Speaker 1: does it make any sense?
[20:41] Speaker 1: Becoming rich and good, is it good?
[20:43] Speaker 1: Rich and dream, is it good?
[20:45] Speaker 1: Or becoming poor and dream, is it bad?
[20:48] Speaker 1: And dream it does not matter because it is only illusion.
[20:52] Speaker 1: Similarly, now here also this is a gross dream.
[20:54] Speaker 1: everything is illusion here simply because of bodily concept of life.
[21:02] Speaker 1: बादाँ भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भ
[21:29] Speaker 1: 
[21:34] Speaker 1: So good and bad, something is good, something is favourable, something is unfavourable.
[21:39] Speaker 1: This is only felt in illusion. When I am in illusion, I am this body.
[21:43] Speaker 1: It's only because of illusion of dream. This is also dream, gross dream.
[21:49] Speaker 1: So that is why our desires are called Manogathan, Mental Concoction.
[21:53] Speaker 1: In a dream everything is mental concoction similarly here also it is only
[22:00] Speaker 1: favourable perceive some another thing and this I develop.
[22:05] Speaker 1: Kaman various material desires.
[22:08] Speaker 1: So Prajahati Yadakamans, so the first symptom of a liberated personality is Prajahati gives
[22:14] Speaker 1: a post such desires which are the result of mental concoction.
[22:18] Speaker 1: There is no desire to get something, there is no desire to avoid anything.
[22:24] Speaker 1: So thus Chetanema, Prabhu told, I am Sannyasi, a Sannyasi supposed to be on a liberated platform.
[22:30] Speaker 1: So on liberated platform, I cannot perceive something as favourable, another thing as unfavourable.
[22:37] Speaker 1: How can I avoid your body, seeing that it is bad, there is nothing good or bad for Sannyasi?
[22:43] Speaker 1: This is called liberated platform, which we have to attain in this life.
[22:47] Speaker 1: So, the first symptom is, one does not have any material desired to avoid something to gain anything.
[22:57] Speaker 1: Aatmannevaatmanadushta sithaprakjyaastadhochete, such a person is satisfied in his own
[23:01] Speaker 1: self.
[23:01] Speaker 1: There is nothing to gain, nothing to lose for a devotee.
[23:05] Speaker 1: His only desire is to serve Krishna with each and every moment and breath of his life.
[23:10] Speaker 1: So if I am having any material desire, some calculation, let me have this thing in life
[23:14] Speaker 1: or let me avoid this thing in life, then we are not stuck on the, still on the sithaprakjya
[23:19] Speaker 1: a black phone.
[23:22] Speaker 1: Next, Dukke Shwana Dvigna Manaha Sukke Shw Vigata Spriha Ha.
[23:30] Speaker 1: Man is not disturbed by Dukha or Sukha.
[23:34] Speaker 1: So-called Misri does not affect a sthetaprakya and in a situation of happiness one does not
[23:41] Speaker 1: become happy.
[23:44] Speaker 1: If somebody tells us in the dream tonight you are going to be very, very rich.
[23:48] Speaker 1: Shall we become happy?
[23:50] Speaker 1: Or in the dream tonight, all your family members will die.
[23:55] Speaker 1: Shall we cry?
[23:57] Speaker 1: Or what is going to happen?
[23:59] Speaker 1: I'm going to lose everyone in dream.
[24:02] Speaker 1: So thus Bhagavadtham explains,
[24:05] Speaker 1: a person does not become happy
[24:07] Speaker 1: for gaining some money in dream
[24:09] Speaker 1: and does not lament when he wakes up.
[24:11] Speaker 1: Similarly, during the dream also, there is no reason to
[24:15] Speaker 1: become happy or lament.
[24:16] Speaker 1: so that should be the situation of a person.
[24:19] Speaker 1: Why should not aspire for any material gain?
[24:21] Speaker 1: And why should not get distressed on the loss of anything?
[24:24] Speaker 1: It is just a dream, temporary perception.
[24:28] Speaker 1: So that's two keshu, Anadwigna Manaha.
[24:31] Speaker 1: Mind is not disturbed in any misery.
[24:34] Speaker 1: And so keshu, Vigata-spriha, one does not desire material happiness.
[24:40] Speaker 1: V.
[24:41] Speaker 1: Teraagabhaya Krodha, Sittadhir Munir Chate, V.
[24:45] Speaker 1: Teraagabhaya Krodha, Sittadhir Munir Chate, V.
[24:51] Speaker 1: have any attachment. This is my father, my children, my mother, my dog, my cat. My
[24:57] Speaker 1: understood is nothing is mine. These are all simply temporary external dresses. In
[25:02] Speaker 1: illusion I am thinking, the soul in this dress belongs to me. It does not, we all belong
[25:07] Speaker 1: to Krishna. In this way we are related to each other as parts and parts of
[25:11] Speaker 1: of Krishna. Otherwise one does not have any
[25:17] Speaker 1: It keeps on changing, it is a temporary structure.
[25:20] Speaker 1: So this one does not have any attachment to anybody in this world.
[25:23] Speaker 1: Vita Raga and there is no attachment and thus there is no fear.
[25:29] Speaker 1: We are fearful because of attachment here in this world.
[25:32] Speaker 1: I will lose my objects of attachment, my situation of attachment, my property, my wealth,
[25:38] Speaker 1: my people.
[25:38] Speaker 1: So, that's when it's completely freed of fear.
[25:44] Speaker 1: So one is completely fearless. Prabhupāda explains.
[25:48] Speaker 1: Because we understand, I'm eternal. Where is the question of fear for a devotee?
[25:52] Speaker 1: I'm eternal. What is profit? What is loss?
[25:56] Speaker 1: And Kurodhaha, one is freed from anger also. Why one is freed from anger?
[26:02] Speaker 1: Anger arises when the lust is not fulfilled.
[26:05] Speaker 1: Material desires are not fulfilled because
[26:08] Speaker 1: Asitaprajya devotee does not have any money.
[26:11] Speaker 1: Where is the question of anger?
[26:13] Speaker 1: There is no question of material desires,
[26:16] Speaker 1: not getting fulfilled.
[26:17] Speaker 1: Thus he is freed from anger.
[26:19] Speaker 1: So Raghav Bhaya Kroda, one has to analyze,
[26:21] Speaker 1: am I completely freed of anger?
[26:23] Speaker 1: Am I completely freed of lust?
[26:25] Speaker 1: Material desires?
[26:27] Speaker 1: Attachment, fear?
[26:29] Speaker 1: Then I can understand yes, I am on
[26:32] Speaker 1: liberated platform.
[26:38] Speaker 1: Yes, Sarvatrana Bhisma is tattat prapya shubhashavam na vinandati na dvejti tase pradnya pratishta.
[26:46] Speaker 1: He was without attachment. Sarvatrana is naha. Anabhisneha is naha. So that's Krishna
[26:56] Speaker 1: is repeating over and over again many times without attachment, without attachment, without
[27:05] Speaker 1: the purpose of all you.
[27:06] Speaker 1: This is the definition of work we are discussing yesterday in the class.
[27:12] Speaker 1: In the Vishnu Purand, work is defined as an activity which gives you detachment.
[27:18] Speaker 1: Work is not something which will entangle you.
[27:21] Speaker 1: Work means karma means that activity which brings you yanna bhandhaya, karma yanna bhandhaya,
[27:28] Speaker 1: which gives you detachment.
[27:31] Speaker 1: So, getting detached is very, very important.
[27:37] Speaker 1: One who does not rejoice when he obtains good.
[27:40] Speaker 1: So why Krishna is repeating these instructions?
[27:42] Speaker 1: Because these are very, very important.
[27:44] Speaker 1: Repetition means something is important.
[27:46] Speaker 1: Similar thing, Krishna has repeated an entire Bhagavad Gita.
[27:50] Speaker 1: Because Krishna knows, even though I talk, they will not understand.
[27:55] Speaker 1: One should not desire anything good.
[27:57] Speaker 1: Actually, there is nothing good here.
[27:58] Speaker 1: you design anything good as
[28:06] Speaker 1: Tatt tatt prapishubhashwam there is nothing Shubh and Ashubh everything is Ashubh here
[28:11] Speaker 1: Everything is in auspicious because we have forgotten our real situation of ecstatic love
[28:16] Speaker 1: 24 hours engagement in the service of Krishna we have forgotten
[28:20] Speaker 1: So everything is in auspicious here
[28:23] Speaker 1: So Shubh and Ashubh does not matter for a devotee
[28:27] Speaker 1: Navinandati, not Vesti, he does not rejoice.
[28:32] Speaker 1: is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge.
[28:41] Speaker 1: Yadah sam harate chayam kuru mo angani vasarvasah indriyan indriyarthe biyastasya pragya pratishta
[28:48] Speaker 1: tha. So what does a person do? He simply sleeps? Let me not act for getting anything
[28:54] Speaker 1: a life, let me not act to avoid anything, no he acts.
[29:02] Speaker 1: it will extend its limbs outside otherwise it will pull it inside in the shell.
[29:08] Speaker 1: One who is able to withdraw his senses, yadas, samharate, chaayam, kurma, kurma, his tortoise,
[29:14] Speaker 1: anganiyva sarvasha, one who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects as he tortoises,
[29:19] Speaker 1: is limbs within the shell, is to be understood as truly situated in knowledge.
[29:25] Speaker 1: So when has to use
[29:27] Speaker 1: Arjuna used his senses to fight.
[29:30] Speaker 1: So, this is how devotee uses his senses perfectly
[29:32] Speaker 1: in the service of Krishna, but not for material sense
[29:36] Speaker 1: gratification.
[29:37] Speaker 1: So, for Krishna's service,
[29:39] Speaker 1: when as to very expert, very hard working,
[29:42] Speaker 1: very much endeavoring and laborious,
[29:44] Speaker 1: but for sense gratification, one is callous,
[29:48] Speaker 1: one pulls the draws the senses inside,
[29:51] Speaker 1: one does not indulge in sense object.
[29:53] Speaker 1: It's a great day.
[29:58] Speaker 1: यह भी भाँवावा समन्विता हावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावा
[30:21] Speaker 1: dhakti which is not
[30:25] Speaker 1: they also cannot. They will attain after a long time because they are on the path. Yes, both of them,
[30:31] Speaker 1: either the impersonalist or the empiric philosopher, because they are trying to understand what is truth.
[30:36] Speaker 1: Another person also is anyway sentimentally playing with doll of Krishna or D.T. of Krishna,
[30:41] Speaker 1: somehow trying to chant and they will also attain because they are trying to approach Krishna,
[30:46] Speaker 1: but they will take a very very long time many many years to perfect.
[30:51] Speaker 1: But if one understands the philosophy very nicely, understands the position of Krishna and
[30:56] Speaker 1: then follows, then in this life one can attain perfection.
[31:04] Speaker 1: But this understanding is not very easy.
[31:10] Speaker 1: That is why the first loka of Bhagavad Gita is very, very important.
[31:14] Speaker 1: What is the first loka? Who has spoken first loka?
[31:18] Speaker 1: Dritrastra. He is spoken only one shloka.
[31:22] Speaker 1: And his position is also very, very unique. There is nobody like Dritrastra.
[31:26] Speaker 1: Why, what is the situation?
[31:31] Speaker 1: Dritrastra uvaacha.
[31:33] Speaker 1: Dharmakshetre kurukshetre samaveta ayudhsava.
[31:36] Speaker 1: Mahamaka pandavaschayava ke makuruvata sanjaya.
[31:40] Speaker 1: What he is asking?
[31:42] Speaker 1: He is doing his calculation.
[31:44] Speaker 1: calculation. What calculation is doing? He wants that. What should happen at any cost?
[31:51] Speaker 1: Even though they have assembled on Kurukshetra, which is Dharmakshetra where Lord Krishna is personally present,
[31:57] Speaker 1: he wants what should happen? And the people who are dear to Krishna should lose. And my son should be victorious.
[32:05] Speaker 1: So he is very eager. What did they do? Did they fight or not? Because Krishna was present as Dharmakshetra,
[32:12] Speaker 1: they can get influenced by the positive.
[32:16] Speaker 1: So, they should not happen. He is very anxious. Did the fight or not?
[32:26] Speaker 1: He is very anxious. Just like the materialist becomes anxious. Many sees. There are overcast conditions.
[32:34] Speaker 1: cricket match me or may not happen did the player not?
[32:39] Speaker 1: He's very anxious.
[32:40] Speaker 1: He is very anxious.
[32:42] Speaker 1: So, Dhritarastra is similarly anxious.
[32:45] Speaker 1: And Dhritarastra is a person who knows that Krishna is God.
[32:50] Speaker 1: So, Vidura is telling, why don't you take shelter?
[32:54] Speaker 1: You know that Krishna is God.
[32:56] Speaker 1: So, it tells you, I know Krishna is God.
[32:59] Speaker 1: But only when Krishna desires, I will take a shelter.
[33:04] Speaker 1: Only when Krishna desires, he will give me wisdom one day.
[33:06] Speaker 1: then I will start ended up with Krishna.
[33:08] Speaker 1: Krishna. So this is a situation of most of us in Krishna consciousness movement. Even though
[33:14] Speaker 1: we have understood that Krishna is God, we continue like Dhritarastra. Yes, I know Krishna
[33:21] Speaker 1: is God. At least we are not Duryodhana. Duryodhana was not knowing that Krishna is God. So we
[33:28] Speaker 1: are like Dhritarastra. I know Krishna is God. When Krishna gives me intelligence, I will
[33:32] Speaker 1: surrender. Now let me continue earning money. Let me continue my attachment.
[33:44] Speaker 1: And so we should try to open our eyes, open our spiritual eyes and it is not easy.
[33:50] Speaker 1: Why this Tarsha could not surrender to Krishna? Even though he is knowing Krishna is God,
[33:54] Speaker 1: he was having material calculation. Too much, why he was having this thing? Because of too much
[34:00] Speaker 1: material attachment which is, since he tells, I cannot help Vidura, I know I am doing wrong,
[34:04] Speaker 1: I know Panda was the right.
[34:08] Speaker 1: Because I am very much attached to my sons, I want them to rule.
[34:12] Speaker 1: So that is why these material attachments are very dangerous.
[34:15] Speaker 1: And it is not easy to come out of these material attachments,
[34:19] Speaker 1: which are because of the concept of duality.
[34:24] Speaker 1: So who can come out of this duality?
[34:29] Speaker 1: Only one who has got mercy of the spiritual master.
[34:32] Speaker 1: Master.
[34:34] Speaker 1: Sansaara dhavanalli l-loka, atranana ya karone ghanada, only there is no other way.
[34:41] Speaker 1: That is why if some British and very advanced without surrendering to the spiritual master,
[34:45] Speaker 1: one should immediately understand this is all not right.
[34:49] Speaker 1: Without following the rules and regulations and pleasing completely satisfying the spiritual
[34:53] Speaker 1: master, surrendering to a spiritual master such a state is not possible at all.
[35:00] Speaker 1: So that is why Prabhupāda explains this is important.
[35:04] Speaker 1: Prabhupāda cots Vishnā Chakravartī Thakur,
[35:06] Speaker 1: that what is bhakti, what is actual bhakti by which we can please the spiritual master.
[35:12] Speaker 1: So Vishnā Chakravartī Thakur explains,
[35:15] Speaker 1: when you go out and meet opposing elements, it is not easy.
[35:21] Speaker 1: One can stay in one place silently and chant Hare Krishna and advance.
[35:24] Speaker 1: Prabhupāda will tell no, that is not going to help you.
[35:26] Speaker 1: Let me take conveniently in my place and chant Hare Krishna.
[35:41] Speaker 1: यह भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी भी �

[36:33] Speaker 1: Sometimes when we face opposing elements, we may face defeat, our arguments will be defeated.
[36:39] Speaker 1: So bhakti is a fight, it is a war.
[36:44] Speaker 1: So this is not out of cultivation of Krishna consciousness rather, this is real cultivation of Krishna consciousness.
[36:51] Speaker 1: If I think comfortably I can live and I can advance and
[37:02] Speaker 1: यह पर तेखेखे ने ने नहावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावावा
[37:21] Speaker 1: what is wood chandle
[37:26] Speaker 1: three hours, three and a half hours they will complete their sixteen rounds.
[37:30] Speaker 1: Very peacefully they will sit down close their eyes and they'll finish.
[37:35] Speaker 1: Wonderful chanting.
[37:38] Speaker 1: And they are not dosing off.
[37:40] Speaker 1: It is not that they are chanting very peacefully hearing each and every word very nicely.
[37:48] Speaker 1: but the
[37:49] Speaker 1: But they also could not surrender, could not advance.
[37:56] Speaker 1: Although they are trying to follow in some or the other format.
[38:00] Speaker 1: So that is why we have to understand chanting Hare Krishna will give us everything that we
[38:05] Speaker 1: want.
[38:06] Speaker 1: It will give us material benefit, whatever we want.
[38:09] Speaker 1: So one should be very, very careful if you have material desires, all those desires will
[38:13] Speaker 1: be fulfilled.
[38:14] Speaker 1: We will do excellent in material world also if you have a
[38:18] Speaker 1: Hari Nam is Krishna himself with all his energies.
[38:23] Speaker 1: But then Bhakti we will not get. Bhakti and Mukti also Krishna will give.
[38:28] Speaker 1: We will be in trance, but that is impersonal trance.
[38:31] Speaker 1: When can attain that impersonal trance also by chanting Hare Krishna?
[38:35] Speaker 1: Your mind will be very peaceful. You will be floating by chanting Hare Krishna.
[38:40] Speaker 1: But this is very different from the real effect of chanting Hare Krishna,
[38:43] Speaker 1: So, which is?
[38:56] Speaker 1: So thus some devotees are able to very completely very much absorb, although that is rare, but that is possible by practice.
[39:04] Speaker 1: But such devotees also were doing so much of chanting, but we have seen they were not eager to render service.
[39:12] Speaker 1: Yes, they were not very much.
[39:18] Speaker 1: hard.
[39:20] Speaker 1: And thus, on the other I am received devotees who are apparently not very careful about chanting,
[39:27] Speaker 1: not able to chant very nicely.
[39:28] Speaker 1: Somehow, although that should not be, we should be very careful, but they are very laborious,
[39:33] Speaker 1: working very hard to serve Krishna and they were able to advance very nice and able to
[39:39] Speaker 1: to develop extraordinary taste also.
[39:44] Speaker 1: So, thus Prabhupātāl artificially, we cannot and we should not try to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.
[39:50] Speaker 1: Manatumi kishe re-vāśnava.
[39:52] Speaker 1: It is not in your position.
[39:55] Speaker 1: Thus Prabhupātāl, go out and preach work hard for Kṛṣṇa.
[39:59] Speaker 1: This is my Guru-Mārājā policy.
[40:03] Speaker 1: This is better than chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa than Prabhupātiles.
[40:06] Speaker 1: So, we have to understand.
[40:08] Speaker 1: This will bring me real spiritual
[40:10] Speaker 1: This is better than chanting Hare Krishna.
[40:13] Speaker 1: Although we should not imitate advanced personalities like Arjuna who just work very hard for
[40:17] Speaker 1: Krishna without chanting, we have to chant also.
[40:21] Speaker 1: Unless we chant, we will not be able to work hard for Krishna, but we should come to this
[40:25] Speaker 1: platform.
[40:26] Speaker 1: This is a real secret.
[40:28] Speaker 1: It is an open secret.
[40:29] Speaker 1: But unless we take shelter of a spiritual master, we will not be able to understand this
[40:33] Speaker 1: secret.
[40:34] Speaker 1: it. Krishna has openly declared who is most dear to me.
[40:41] Speaker 1: Manu preaches very clearly it is told, na chata smath manu but who preaches nobody preaches,
[40:47] Speaker 1: you see in Krishna consciousness movement also nobody preaches.
[40:51] Speaker 1: Everyone chants does DT worship, offers bhoga, eats prasadam, go to vrindavan dham, do
[40:57] Speaker 1: karthik everything but nobody preaches because it is uncomfortable activity to go out, venture
[41:05] Speaker 1: old planet.
[41:10] Speaker 1: That is why it is called confidential, you keep on reading, keep on hearing,
[41:14] Speaker 1: well, we will not realise, I have to do this thing,
[41:17] Speaker 1: when we will not realise.
[41:20] Speaker 1: A small fraction are able to realise and you see their spiritual advancement.
[41:24] Speaker 1: Those who have worked very hard for preaching, they were advanced so fast, so quickly,
[41:28] Speaker 1: so quickly they have advanced, they get all realisation.
[41:33] Speaker 1: They might not have even finished Bhagavad Gita, little bit they will read and they will realize
[41:37] Speaker 1: everything.
[41:38] Speaker 1: And others have become great scholars, have spent many many years in Krishna consciousness,
[41:43] Speaker 1: but same, Dhritarastra, what my sons will do, what my sons will get, what my daughters
[41:48] Speaker 1: will get, this calculation goes on, what I will get.
[41:52] Speaker 1: So, we have to understand, Prabhupattas, we have to please Acharya's, Acharya's will
[41:59] Speaker 1: please buy this we are not on the platform
[42:02] Speaker 1: Acharya has shown by their own example.
[42:04] Speaker 1: Haridas Thakura before he took to chanting, even door to door.
[42:07] Speaker 1: And he requested people to chant.
[42:09] Speaker 1: He met with unfavorable elements.
[42:11] Speaker 1: So Vishnatha Chakravaarti Thakura explains,
[42:13] Speaker 1: this is cultivation of Krishna consciousness.
[42:15] Speaker 1: This is the Tapasya that we have to take.
[42:17] Speaker 1: Without Tapasya, we cannot advance.
[42:20] Speaker 1: It is not at all convenient to go and talk to strangers,
[42:23] Speaker 1: start to convince people where nobody is interested in Krishna consciousness.
[42:26] Speaker 1: It is not convenient.
[42:28] Speaker 1: And when we go out we see nobody.
[42:31] Speaker 1: I have touched thousand people, one has not become Krishna conscious.
[42:36] Speaker 1: And then we will understand what is my position because I am not spiritually powerful.
[42:40] Speaker 1: Then we will increase our spiritual practices.
[42:45] Speaker 1: Because when preaching fails, it is mainly because of lack of our spiritual potency.
[42:51] Speaker 2: So then I will understand what is my spiritual potency not able to make one devotee.
[42:55] Speaker 1: Then when works hard, takes care of his spiritual life in this way.
[43:01] Speaker 2: So this is the secret. So we have to try and we have to work very hard.
[43:08] Speaker 2: Go out, preach, try to convince people, even though nobody's convinced does not matter.
[43:12] Speaker 2: We will advance, we will be able to draw mercy.
[43:16] Speaker 2: And then eventually we will be able to convince people and make them devotees also.
[43:19] Speaker 2: So, by taking hardships for spreading Krishna consciousness in this way,
[43:29] Speaker 2: Then Buddha bhava samanvita, then there would be real symptoms of love of God.
[43:34] Speaker 2: So it cannot be attained in a very easy way, very convenient way, nor by doing speculation.
[43:40] Speaker 2: But when it's to follow the footsteps of the Acharya's and satisfy the Acharya's by
[43:45] Speaker 2: our hard work, and in this way we'll be able to make spiritual advancements.
[43:49] Speaker 2: So this is called real spiritual life.
[43:51] Speaker 2: Follow the rules and regulations very nicely.
[43:56] Speaker 2: by pleasing the acharya's.
[43:59] Speaker 2: And then we also can hope to have such symptoms with the Dwarka Vasis are having because
[44:04] Speaker 2: the are eternal associates they have come from the spiritual world with Krishna and thus
[44:10] Speaker 2: they cannot bear separation from Krishna even for a moment we have to aspire for this platform
[44:14] Speaker 2: for this stage.
[44:16] Speaker 2: And when Krishna was out every moment they were expecting now Krishna will come, now Krishna
[44:20] Speaker 2: will come.
[44:21] Speaker 2: in this way there are
[44:21] Speaker 2: In this way they are having apparent depression and melancholia, but actually it is spiritual
[44:26] Speaker 2: ecstasy.
[44:28] Speaker 2: And as soon as Krishna's sound is conscious, immediately they became very enthused and
[44:32] Speaker 2: jubilant.
[44:33] Speaker 2: So we'll see further how they receive Lord Krishna in the kingdom.
[44:36] Speaker 2: We will not hear any questions.
[44:49] Speaker 3: I have a question.
[44:53] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[44:54] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[44:57] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[44:58] Speaker 1: 
[44:58] Speaker 1: 
[44:58] Speaker 1: 
[44:58] Speaker 1: 
[44:58] Speaker 1: 
[44:58] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[44:58] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:00] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:02] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:03] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:03] Speaker 1: 
[45:04] Speaker 1: 
[45:04] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:04] Speaker 1: 
[45:06] Speaker 1: 
[45:06] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:06] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:07] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:08] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:09] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:09] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:11] Speaker 1: I will ask you.
[45:12] Speaker 1: I will ask you.

[45:45] Speaker 2: So, thus, Prabhu Patel, yes, they may chant so many things, they will tell like this, but
[45:45] Speaker 1: 
[45:50] Speaker 2: if you hear continuously, then you will see what philosophy they are talking of.
[45:53] Speaker 2: So nobody can repeat the words of Krishna unless they are actually on that platform.
[45:58] Speaker 2: So if we hear, we will understand, they will talk of material things also.
[46:02] Speaker 2: Yes, chant, but we have to have balance, you know.
[46:06] Speaker 2: Do Dharm also nicely, do Karm also nicely, do Karm also nicely, do Moksha also nicely,
[46:12] Speaker 2: And then do back the also now.
[46:16] Speaker 2: And like this, they will come to Monday in platform,
[46:18] Speaker 2: ultimately, and talk all these things.
[46:21] Speaker 2: So that is why simply by hearing one can understand,
[46:24] Speaker 2: of course, when it is spent, carefully, more time in hearing them.
[46:35] Speaker 2: In that, you can talk so that online they can hear.
[46:37] Speaker 3: Prabhu, how to understand that while pitching one should not consider himself a-
[46:43] Speaker 3: One should not consider himself as a doer as a doer.
[46:47] Speaker 2: Yes, how to understand this.
[46:48] Speaker 2: It is easy because even while preaching or while doing any activity,
[46:54] Speaker 2: I am not the doer.
[46:55] Speaker 2: Prakratayi, kriya manani, material nature is doing.
[46:58] Speaker 2: I am simply instrument.
[47:01] Speaker 2: Suppose I become brain dead.
[47:02] Speaker 2: I will not be able to think, perceive anything.
[47:05] Speaker 2: But I get paralysis.
[47:06] Speaker 2: Or if I get a different body, I will act differently.
[47:08] Speaker 2: if I
[47:14] Speaker 2: Yes. So thus we think that I am doing anything. I am not doing.
[47:18] Speaker 2: Material nature is doing and through the body given to us. So as per our body we behave helplessly.
[47:26] Speaker 2: So similarly when we engage in preaching also again we are doing Krishna's work under control of Fremati Radharani.
[47:34] Speaker 3: So we are controlling every day.
[47:36] Speaker 3: So suppose this no-
[47:39] Speaker 3: Why shall we serve Krishna?
[47:41] Speaker 3: So we are dependent on this knowledge.
[47:43] Speaker 3: We are dependent on the realization of this knowledge, which is given by Krishna from the heart.
[47:47] Speaker 3: So that's again, Krishna is working.
[47:49] Speaker 3: We are not working.
[47:50] Speaker 3: So either Shematir Adharani is working or Durga Deves is working through us.
[47:54] Speaker 3: We are always an instrument.
[47:55] Speaker 3: So we can choose, I want to become instrument of Durga or Shematir Adharani.
[47:59] Speaker 1: 
[48:00] Speaker 1: Thank you.
[48:05] Speaker 1: Hare Krishna, Prabhu, we see that Drutra-Shrava was so much materially attached, but we also know that
[48:13] Speaker 1: Drutra-Shrava was a son of Vasudev only, even with Ruvaj son of Vasudev.
[48:18] Speaker 1: Yes.
[48:18] Speaker 1: Even Sukadeva Goswami also son of Vasudev.
[48:20] Speaker 1: Yes.
[48:21] Speaker 1: And Vasudeva is Krishna himself.
[48:22] Speaker 3: Yes.
[48:23] Speaker 1: So why there is so much difference between sons of Krishna directly?
[48:26] Speaker 3: So these are the important instructions, what to speak of when Krishna himself was there,
[48:31] Speaker 3: Narakasura was his son and he became demon great.
[48:37] Speaker 3: all the princes. Thus these are the instructions, even though you are son of Krishna, you can
[48:44] Speaker 3: become a hardcore materialist. So that is the way we have to be very, very cautious about
[48:49] Speaker 3: our association.
[48:52] Speaker 2: direction.
[48:55] Speaker 2: So in preaching through, I am seeing very dangerous, if you call.
[49:02] Speaker 2: It is very dangerous to go out and then preach.
[49:06] Speaker 1: 
[49:06] Speaker 2: Because I am not so much controlled about my senses.
[49:12] Speaker 2: So many mata jis come.
[49:15] Speaker 2: So it becomes very dangerous because my attacks.
[49:19] Speaker 2: So how to preach?
[49:21] Speaker 2: Because the moment you get this kind of thinking in the mind and then you get what is it?
[49:27] Speaker 2: You feel bad?
[49:28] Speaker 2: You feel bad, so it becomes very difficult to preach.
[49:32] Speaker 2: Maybe often, our owner has spent merely come back,
[49:35] Speaker 2: he would do your chanting and other things.
[49:37] Speaker 2: So this is a challenge in the preaching,
[49:42] Speaker 2: because in the time of Faridah's Takaor,
[49:45] Speaker 2: it's not like that. They were preaching in a very sober community.
[49:50] Speaker 2: Now if you go out and then preach,
[49:54] Speaker 2: Mataji's are almost half-naked.
[49:55] Speaker 2: cut right.
[49:57] Speaker 2: So.
[49:57] Speaker 2: So it is very more, far more difficult, dangerous.
[50:00] Speaker 2: In fact, I am a loose my Krishna-Krishna-Krishna's
[50:03] Speaker 2: that's the kind of feeling I get whenever I go out for preaching.
[50:07] Speaker 2: What is your suggestion?
[50:09] Speaker 2: And when we go to office?
[50:10] Speaker 2: Yeah, so office, it's not so much bad.
[50:13] Speaker 2: I would say because I have very focused work.
[50:16] Speaker 2: I have my work and then...
[50:17] Speaker 2: Okay, your office is nice.
[50:19] Speaker 2: Different.
[50:20] Speaker 2: And then it's...
[50:21] Speaker 2: The exact same question, Deode, is asked.
[50:23] Speaker 2: How will you go to office?
[50:24] Speaker 2: I go to my office.
[50:31] Speaker 2: I will have my Prasadam as well.
[50:32] Speaker 3: Similarly, when we go outside we should try to go to a place where people are not half
[50:37] Speaker 3: or full naked where they are very close and they are really going to preach.
[50:43] Speaker 3: In Kiranandani there is a garden here.
[50:46] Speaker 3: You go there, you find young couple sitting and kissing each other.
[50:48] Speaker 3: Don't go there to preach.
[50:50] Speaker 3: There are other places.
[50:52] Speaker 3: Go outside a crossbutt.
[50:56] Speaker 3: Go to Starbucks where people are sitting doing some work there, you can reach.
[50:59] Speaker 3: Go outside, DMR people have come to purchase.
[51:02] Speaker 3: They come with good clothes over there.
[51:05] Speaker 3: Like this, we can go to favourable places.
[51:08] Speaker 2: One another question I have about.
[51:10] Speaker 2: In Krishna consciousness there are two kinds of Anandis.
[51:14] Speaker 2: Kostya Anandis and Bajanandis.
[51:15] Speaker 3: Just to continue further.
[51:17] Speaker 3: So some devotees would ask this thing, they are Prabhupada.
[51:20] Speaker 3: I go outside and I am getting carried up.
[51:22] Speaker 3: So, no.
[51:23] Speaker 3: When we are going out for preaching, we are conducted by internal potency.
[51:26] Speaker 3: Yes, sometimes there could be some of these distractions anyway.
[51:29] Speaker 3: But if we continue preaching, all these distractions gradually will go away.
[51:33] Speaker 3: It will happen only when we go out and when we preach.
[51:36] Speaker 3: Then we will not be disturbed, rather.
[51:38] Speaker 3: Other person will become deported.
[51:40] Speaker 3: Preaching is so powerful.
[51:41] Speaker 3: Thus, even the devotees were very new.
[51:44] Speaker 3: Even the new devotees, especially in the Western countries,
[51:46] Speaker 3: Please provide a couple of questions.
[51:54] Speaker 3: temple you are a new devotee, Proopartil no new devotee is also should go out for book distribution
[51:59] Speaker 3: in that way they will become very strong and advanced. So it appears that it is disturbing
[52:03] Speaker 3: but if you continue having faith on the spiritual master of course as I discuss we should be
[52:09] Speaker 3: discriminating that don't go on a beach to preach where people are without many clothes
[52:16] Speaker 4: you might get more
[52:23] Speaker 4: try to discriminate, but we must go out, Prabhupāda told by that we become very strong and
[52:28] Speaker 4: all these things will stop affecting us. So it is understood. Initially we might get disturbed
[52:32] Speaker 4: by all these things, but by praying to Prabhupāda, following the rules and regulations nicely
[52:37] Speaker 4: and going out seriously to preach, will stop getting affected.
[52:42] Speaker 4: there are two kinds of devotees mentioned who
[52:51] Speaker 4: Pure devotees don't even come out. Are they not pure devotees? How is that allowed first of all?
[52:58] Speaker 4: Because preaching is very important. We are seeing Mahaprabhu's direct instructions as they
[53:03] Speaker 4: Kotharakavakrishnam, but how they are doing pitching what is, why the those kind of
[53:09] Speaker 4: the word sexist.
[53:10] Speaker 4: Yes.
[53:11] Speaker 4: So.
[53:12] Speaker 4: So, there are two kinds of devotees, Bhajna-Nandhi and Gosh-Teya-Nandhi.
[53:19] Speaker 4: Bhajna-Nandhi means they just take pleasure in Bhajna-Nandhi, chanting and hearing the
[53:23] Speaker 4: name of Krishna.
[53:25] Speaker 4: Another category is Gosh-Teya-Nandhi, who takes pleasure expanding the number of devotees,
[53:32] Speaker 4: increasing the number of devotees.
[53:35] Speaker 4: And we come in the...
[53:37] Speaker 4: This is a quick succession of ghost and and these you want to go and preach.
[53:40] Speaker 4: go preach. Why Bhajnana Nandhi does not preach Kravupada explains? So, Bhajnana Nandhi thinks
[53:46] Speaker 4: I am not capable of preaching one thing. One thing is he thinks everybody is a devotee
[53:51] Speaker 4: home to preach. Only I am not devotee. So, this is one understanding. That whole world
[53:56] Speaker 4: is devotee and only I am not devotee. Only I am not engaged in service of Krishna.
[54:01] Speaker 4: This very exalted platform. So, such a person may not preach. And another understanding
[54:07] Speaker 4: And in this video, I will show you how to make a new video.
[54:12] Speaker 4: Let me do my vajan only.
[54:14] Speaker 4: So in this way, heat is not preach.
[54:19] Speaker 4: But we cannot become vajananandhi by doing vajan, in this age.
[54:24] Speaker 4: In earlier ages some other time we would have become vajananandhi by doing vajan.
[54:28] Speaker 4: But now our bodies are active as Arjuna told, Krishna, I want to become same thing, vajananandhi.
[54:34] Speaker 4: I want to take some yaas I don't want to fight
[54:37] Speaker 4: Arjuna to
[54:39] Speaker 4: So, Krishna told you will not be able to take Sannyas because you have got body of a Shatriya.
[54:44] Speaker 4: Prakratya Ikriya Manani has just discussed.
[54:47] Speaker 4: Now you are declining to fight. This is because of material attachment.
[54:52] Speaker 4: Later you will anyway fight because you have got body of Shatriya.
[54:57] Speaker 4: So now if you fight according to my instructions, you will get the credit.
[55:00] Speaker 4: Your life would be glorious.
[55:03] Speaker 4: So in a similar way our bodies are filled with Rajas
[55:08] Speaker 4: Bhajan in one place, what will happen? Prabhupāt is you will think of women and
[55:13] Speaker 4: money. So it is not for NBFC and also like I just discussed many cases who are
[55:18] Speaker 4: doing very nice Bhajan sitting and doing but not doing service not working very
[55:23] Speaker 4: hard for Kṛṣṇa they could not advance much in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So that is
[55:29] Speaker 4: the Prabhupāda stool, this is the way. So one thing is this is one under.
[55:36] Speaker 4: So we have to work. So work for Krishna. Any way we are working all of us very hard in Kalyuga.
[55:42] Speaker 4: So use this tendency in the service of Krishna. This is the way to reach platform.
[55:47] Speaker 4: So we can see Phaleena Pari Chiyate, let people do Bhajan and then you see what is their consciousness.
[55:52] Speaker 4: They'll be still stuck on the material platform.
[55:54] Speaker 4: Pravapata, he's living in Rindavan. Just like a monkey is living in Rindavan.
[55:58] Speaker 4: He is eating fruits and everything but he is having doesn't move.
[56:06] Speaker 4: eating only fruits and milks but then not having good character, having all material desires. So
[56:14] Speaker 4: thus for us people in Kalioga it is very important to dovetail the nature of our body that we have
[56:19] Speaker 4: in the service of Krishna. Second thing is if we follow this sam pradha, this parampara we have to
[56:25] Speaker 4: or satisfy RH areas and RH areas are satisfied when we preach.
[56:32] Speaker 4: exalted understanding. That is why the greatest spiritual position is attained
[56:37] Speaker 4: by following the sam Pradaya. Respect to everyone who is a devotee of Krishna.
[56:42] Speaker 4: But then Chetanema Aaprava came and then he summarized everything. He summarized
[56:47] Speaker 4: all the four vashnavas sam Pradaya's, any gave this philosophy. So thus we should
[56:51] Speaker 4: not get deviated by this sam Pradaya, that sam Pradaya. We should understand what
[56:54] Speaker 4: What is perfect?
[56:55] Speaker 4: Krishna has been Krishna has very clearly told.
[57:00] Speaker 4: one who preaches, has Krishna told, there is nobody dear to me, then the one who chants
[57:03] Speaker 4: always.
[57:05] Speaker 4: No, Krishna has very clearly told in Bhagavad Gita.
[57:10] Speaker 4: So that is why one should not think, oh that is one Sampradaya, this is another Sampradaya,
[57:15] Speaker 4: I have this understanding, they have that understanding, yes, they are different moods of serving
[57:19] Speaker 4: Krishna.
[57:19] Speaker 4: But Chaitanamahapra was came and he gave the culmination of all the four Sampradayas.
[57:24] Speaker 4: So it is not exactly Madhva Sampradaya also although it is based on Madhva Charya's philosophy.
[57:33] Speaker 4: So Godi Sampradaya, this Sampradaya, it is different exactly from Tatvavadis who follow
[57:39] Speaker 4: the Madhva succession.
[57:40] Speaker 4: It is it is summary of all the Sampradayas.
[57:44] Speaker 4: And it is the perfection of instruction which has been given.
[57:48] Speaker 4: And thus we can see who is following this Sampradaya of preaching.
[57:51] Speaker 4: Nagaradi Garam Chattanema Proto-Sainting.
[57:55] Speaker 4: Sarvat thar prachar hoi bae mo rana,
[57:57] Speaker 4: Amar agya ya,
[57:58] Speaker 4: Guru haya tae dita rae deesh,
[58:00] Speaker 4: On my order, you become spiritual master.
[58:03] Speaker 4: So thus Prabhupāda, use very strong words.
[58:07] Speaker 4: That you are telling, I do not go outside vindavan,
[58:10] Speaker 4: What is this nonsense?
[58:12] Speaker 4: Prabhupāda, use the word, what is this nonsense?
[58:15] Speaker 4: Krishna has told,
[58:16] Speaker 4: Chetha na maa probu has told,
[58:18] Speaker 4: Fritvi te āchhe,
[58:20] Speaker 4: as many towns and villages
[58:24] Speaker 4: MY NAME SHOULD BE BREASHED
[58:26] Speaker 4: AND YOU ARE TELLING I DO NOT GO OUT OF RINDA VAN
[58:29] Speaker 4: SO HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD PROBUPA?
[58:31] Speaker 4: HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD CHATTA NEMA APRABU?
[58:33] Speaker 4: CHATTA NEMA APRABU IS STOLD ON EVERY TOWN IN VILAGE
[58:36] Speaker 4: AS MANY TOWNSEN VILAGE ZAR ACROSS PRITIVI
[58:38] Speaker 4: PRITIVI TE AACHE
[58:40] Speaker 4: PREACHING SHOULD HAPPEN
[58:41] Speaker 4: IF YOU DO NOT GO OUT OF RINDA VAN
[58:43] Speaker 4: THEN AMARAG YAGGURU AYA TARAI DASH
[58:46] Speaker 4: ON MY ODDER YOU COME GURU
[58:48] Speaker 4: ...
[58:49] Speaker 4: ...
[58:53] Speaker 4: And the same instruction of Mahaprabhu is given by Krishna. Nobody is dearer than the person
[58:58] Speaker 4: who preaches. So thus it is not about Bhajananandhi or Goshti Anandhi or this Sampradaya or that
[59:05] Speaker 4: Sampradaya. We have to follow what is there in the scriptures. Fortunately we are in Sampradaya,
[59:10] Speaker 4: which explains the perfection of all the knowledge of the scriptures.
[59:14] Speaker 4: Krishna Vandana Tusha Krishna Sangho Panga Sir Parshall
[59:18] Speaker 4: In Kali, how Krishna has to be worshipped?
[59:21] Speaker 4: There are many ways in which people worship Krishna, but
[59:24] Speaker 4: Sumed as the most intelligent people, how shall they worship Krishna?
[59:31] Speaker 4: Yagya is Sankirtana, Taya ira, they worship a unique form of Krishna,
[59:35] Speaker 4: who is, Krishna, Warnam, who is always chanting the name of Krishna.
[59:38] Speaker 4: which temperatire worships the form of Lord who is always chanting.
[59:45] Speaker 4: فولور صف چتے نمہ پر بھو دے ورشپ چتے نمہ پر بھو.
[59:49] Speaker 4: And this is not sam Pradaya understanding. This is, yes this is sam Pradaya understanding,
[59:55] Speaker 4: but this is Bhagavad understanding. Bhagavad tamtels in Kalyuga you have to worship this form of the Lord.
[60:00] Speaker 4: Who is?
[60:04] Speaker 4: Krishna Mauna Maa Na Maa is always chanting Krishna's name.
[60:07] Speaker 4: Many people worship Krishna, but nobody's or very less people are able to understand.
[60:12] Speaker 4: Off course, bye for now.
[60:13] Speaker 4: 我是 Marciana.
[60:17] Speaker 4: form of Kṛṣṇa who is Kṛṣṇa-marnam who is always chanting Kṛṣṇa's name and whose complexion is
[60:22] Speaker 4: a Kṛṣṇa whose complexion is bright or golden opposite to Kṛṣṇa-marn, dark complexion. So everyone
[60:31] Speaker 4: worships dark complexion sorry dark complexion lord lord Kṛṣṇa every one worships but lord Goranga
[60:55] Speaker 4: ھای
[60:57] Speaker 4: ھای
[60:58] Speaker 4: ھای
[60:59] Speaker 4: ھای
[61:00] Speaker 4: ھای
[61:00] Speaker 4: ھای
[61:00] Speaker 4: ھا
[61:01] Speaker 1: 
[61:01] Speaker 1: 
[61:01] Speaker 1: 
[61:01] Speaker 1: 
[61:01] Speaker 4: ھ
[61:02] Speaker 4: ھ
[61:03] Speaker 1: 
[61:03] Speaker 1: 
[61:03] Speaker 4: ھ
[61:05] Speaker 1: 
[61:05] Speaker 4: ھ
[61:05] Speaker 1: 
[61:05] Speaker 1: 
[61:05] Speaker 1: 
[61:05] Speaker 1: 
[61:08] Speaker 4: ھ
[61:09] Speaker 1: 
[61:13] Speaker 4: देवर्शिविंबब़े, संकिर्तन यद्याद्या.
[61:15] Speaker 4: Who takes this sankheerthan यद्याद्या as the topmost action of spiritual life?
[61:21] Speaker 4: Godi-Sampradha hai.
[61:25] Speaker 4: Others may do, but it is extra-activity.
[61:29] Speaker 4: So, thus we have to understand,
[61:31] Speaker 4: and Chetanemaaprabuy came and he developed all the philosophies of Acharyas.
[61:36] Speaker 4: of his of Acharya's.
[61:38] Speaker 4: Shri Pashankaracharya came, but this philosophy was up for a particular situation.
[61:45] Speaker 4: It is not supposed to be followed universally always for attaining the ultimate perfection.
[61:51] Speaker 4: As we can see again, it is based on the scriptures.
[61:54] Speaker 4: Janad Madhvi Mukhan Guru, Go and make people averse to me.
[61:58] Speaker 4: Maya Vada Masash Shastra, Amprejda, incorrect interpretation of the Vedas.
[62:02] Speaker 4: So Shankaracharya cannot make mistake, he is Lord Shiva himself.
[62:06] Speaker 4: Vesnavanaam yasashambhu, the greatest Vesnava.
[62:09] Speaker 4: So Prabhupāda gives example.
[62:11] Speaker 4: Once somebody's horse had a trouble, he got a bit swelling on the neck, the horse.
[62:18] Speaker 4: So then the vet was called, that piece cured my horse.
[62:22] Speaker 4: So what did the vet do?
[62:26] Speaker 4: He struck with hammer on the neck of the horse.
[62:30] Speaker 4: and this swelling disappeared and Hors-Beat him cured.
[62:34] Speaker 4: So then another person was observing,
[62:36] Speaker 4: he told it is so easy to become doctor,
[62:40] Speaker 4: especially to cure swelling,
[62:41] Speaker 4: simply you have to go and strike with hammer.
[62:43] Speaker 4: And the person was like,
[62:44] Speaker 4: so he also became doctor.
[62:47] Speaker 4: And whenever anybody would call,
[62:48] Speaker 4: he would go and strike the swelling.
[62:50] Speaker 4: So then,
[62:51] Speaker 4: so then portion with a hammer
[62:54] Speaker 4: and then the patient would die.
[62:57] Speaker 4: So after a couple of failure treatments,
[63:00] Speaker 4: see a pro is this doctor he told
[63:08] Speaker 4: So why this is happening he told you fool
[63:11] Speaker 4: That horse had swallowed
[63:17] Speaker 4: A squash
[63:19] Speaker 4: Squashes pumpkin kind of ash guard
[63:23] Speaker 4: So he is swallowed the squash that is why he got stuck in his neck.
[63:27] Speaker 4: So that was the reason of the swelling.
[63:29] Speaker 4: So when I stuck...
[63:32] Speaker 4: thus the horse was cured. So it was this striking was for this particular situation. So like
[63:41] Speaker 4: this others would not understand the particular situation and entire country was following Buddhism,
[63:46] Speaker 4: they could not have taken to Vedas. People would not have followed, subscribed to Vedic
[63:51] Speaker 4: understanding unless they would have given this particular interpretation of Vedas which
[63:55] Speaker 4: towards the Buddhist understanding.
[64:19] Speaker 4: ھوڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑڑ
[64:24] Speaker 4: further, Chetana Mahaprava being God himself he came to establish Yuga Dharma gave perfection of philosophy.
[64:31] Speaker 4: So thus and thus we understand that this is perfection of philosophy. Who follows Krishna,
[64:37] Speaker 4: Varnam, Tushak, Krishna, and this is the way Chama Samuni told, Navyogindra has told Maharaj
[64:43] Speaker 4: Nimi, Long ago in Bhagavatambit is recorded. So thus these things are there in the scriptures but
[64:47] Speaker 4: it is confidential. That is why unless we take shelter of a bona fide Parampara we will not be
[64:52] Speaker 4: to understand.
[64:58] Speaker 4: following San Kirtan? Why am I not worshipping Lord Chaitanya? Krishna, Venom, Tusha,
[65:03] Speaker 4: Krishna, he is the only incarnation who chants the name of Krishna, whose complexion
[65:06] Speaker 4: is not this thing. Krishna, dark. So why am I not following Bhagavatam? It is not about
[65:13] Speaker 4: this Sampradha, that Sampradha, I am already following something. No, understand. That
[65:19] Speaker 4: that here is this sampled iZ Perfection culmination.
[65:22] Speaker 4: So if I want perfection, I should try to follow it, follow these teachings.
[65:27] Speaker 4: So I should worship Lord Caitanya, I should follow the instructions of Lord Caitanya, I should
[65:32] Speaker 4: follow the instructions of Krishna, Krishna is only declared, nobody is dearer, bhavita
[65:36] Speaker 4: natchametashman, in the future also nobody shall be dearer than the one who preaches.
[65:43] Speaker 4: So the entire advancement of bhakti depends upon pleasing Krishna and Krishna is mostly
[65:54] Speaker 4: So, thus we have to work very hard and following the footsteps of Acharya's
[65:59] Speaker 4: and these are the instructions of Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam.
[66:02] Speaker 4: And by this we can attain perfection.
[66:07] Speaker 4: I had a two-point question.
[66:11] Speaker 4: Does preaching at any point of time get comfortable?
[66:16] Speaker 4: Yes, so preaching also become.
[66:23] Speaker 4: As we venture more or we take on more risk bigger, bigger responsibilities.
[66:28] Speaker 4: Yes, now I am able to make hundred people chant. Plan how can I make thousand people chant now?
[66:33] Speaker 4: Plan how can I make one million people? Plan how can I make entire country Krishna conscious? How to become?
[66:39] Speaker 4: How to make Prime Minister a devotee?
[66:43] Speaker 4: So like this we always increase it.
[66:46] Speaker 4: The last one is that it's a war, Prabhupāta's preaching is war.
[66:51] Speaker 4: The not-thing preaching is easy going, singing, dancing, chanting,
[66:54] Speaker 4: harībho, sometimes.
[66:59] Speaker 4: So, Prabhupāta's preaching is war.
[67:01] Speaker 4: In war, there is risk.
[67:03] Speaker 4: We have to take risk, Prabhupāta's Krishna becomes very much pleased
[67:07] Speaker 4: when he sees devotees are taking risk for me.
[67:10] Speaker 4: So, this is practical activity, Krishna is a person.
[67:14] Speaker 4: When somebody takes risk for us, are we not pleased?
[67:18] Speaker 4: So, that's we have to take risk for Krishna.
[67:20] Speaker 4: There is a responsibility, there is risk,
[67:22] Speaker 4: and there is danger, just as preaching.
[67:24] Speaker 4: Just like in a war, a person keeps on taking greater risk.
[67:27] Speaker 4: Now, let me defeat this king also.
[67:29] Speaker 4: Let me defeat that king also.
[67:30] Speaker 4: Let me defeat third king also.
[67:32] Speaker 4: Entire world, my rule should be there.
[67:34] Speaker 4: So, the preaching is war in this way we have to.
[67:38] Speaker 4: and I have seen like devotees who go out on book distribution.
[67:46] Speaker 4: when they are actually touching people and giving books and not. But the first thing that they
[67:51] Speaker 4: feel that is the most, how it is just going up. Yes. So, Manon, they know that yes on field,
[67:57] Speaker 4: I am very much blissful. Yes. But this one step, the first step it is getting very hard.
[68:03] Speaker 4: Yes. So what can devotees do about this? So that is why we have to have Sankey Ritann going
[68:09] Speaker 4: going together.
[68:14] Speaker 4: If you are not feeling other person will tell Prabhu, it's time. Let us go. On our own, we may feel lazy.
[68:21] Speaker 4: So form a group, decide and then go out. So that is the Sankey Ritann. Following an association is
[68:27] Speaker 4: very, very important. We will finish any questions. Sorry, online we could not take. Yeah.
[68:37] Speaker 4: I think it's not probably...
[68:42] Speaker 4: Is there a past time associated with it?
[68:45] Speaker 4: I'm sorry, I'm not aware of it.
[68:48] Speaker 4: Hare Krishna Prabhu, many times we see even though someone is preaching but not preaching,
[68:53] Speaker 4: but is not advancing that much, not able to develop love for Krishna.
[68:59] Speaker 4: He is felt, he feels, it seems he is doing it on material platform.
[69:05] Speaker 4: What is the
[69:07] Speaker 4: Yes, so discussing preaching we have to understand. The preaching is based on chanting, hearing,
[69:13] Speaker 4: following, rules and regulations very nicely. If we are ourselves, not following what shall
[69:17] Speaker 4: we preach? So thus Sanatana Goswami told Hari Dastaka, some people behave very nicely.
[69:25] Speaker 4: Means they will follow, regulative principles, rules and regulations very nicely, but they
[69:29] Speaker 4: will not preach. Others they preach but do not behave nicely.
[69:35] Speaker 4: But you are so nice that you behave, you follow and then you preach also.
[69:39] Speaker 4: This is what we have to do.
[69:41] Speaker 4: We have to be very, very strict in following the rules and regulations and then preach.
[69:45] Speaker 4: Then there would be perfection.
[69:47] Speaker 4: So this we have to take help of devotees, how to follow rules and regulations nicely.
[69:53] Speaker 4: Hare Krishna Prabhu, you said that we should follow Racharya and preach.
[69:59] Speaker 4: but once I heard in one lecture that we should do only
[70:04] Speaker 4: Yes, so authorized service will be nothing but service for preaching.
[70:08] Speaker 4: So preaching is a mission just like army, army fights a war, but then only few people are there on the battle front.
[70:14] Speaker 4: Others are somebody's drivers carrying out the supplies, somebody's store keeper taking charge of the store,
[70:21] Speaker 4: somebody's doctor also among the doctors healing the wounded soldiers.
[70:24] Speaker 4: Some people are there actually on the front fighting but all of them are actually soldiers.
[70:35] Speaker 4: preacher. But somebody will be required to cook so that other people can honor the
[70:40] Speaker 4: salam and go out for preaching. Somebody will be required to clean. Somebody will be
[70:43] Speaker 4: required to manage. Somebody will be required to ride, read, paint, code etc. So all of
[70:48] Speaker 4: them are preachers. So that is why we have to do. Preaching means assigned service. If
[70:55] Speaker 4: Designing, developing a website is required for preaching.
[71:00] Speaker 4: get absorbed completely designed best of the websites and that is actually preaching.
[71:06] Speaker 4: So preaching is not whimsical but under proper just like commander tells you do this service
[71:10] Speaker 4: you fight in this way you this is order for you. So under the order of the commander or
[71:17] Speaker 4: our authorities we have to execute the service.
